The path towards fully understanding the relationship between host diversity and disease involves identifying the underlying mechanisms. Community composition likely affects disease risk since individual species vary in host competency, the ability to acquire and transmit a pathogen, and abundance. Forecasting how competency and abundance influence the diversity-disease relationship depends on community disassembly, the processes that determine how species are lost from communities.  

Starting in ~~March~~ October 2020, I will simulate community disassembly by creating a series of nested artificial plant communities to empirically test how changes in species composition impact the spread of a fungal plant pathogen. I will be using greenhouse mesocosms consisting of crop seedlings contained in mesocosms inoculated with the soilborne pathogen, *Rhizoctonia solani*. My primary goal is to examine how changes in host competency and density across a richness gradient affects disease. I also will predict infection probability as a function of a communityâ€™s average host competency, density, and richness to estimate the relative effects of species composition and richness per se.
