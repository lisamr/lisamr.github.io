Unlike abiotic disturbances that cause discrete, non-expanding canopy gaps, biotic mortality agents can create gaps that continue to grow for many years (**see sidebar for common agents**). Yosemite Valley is an example of a natural landscape in the Sierra Nevada that has seen substantial growth in canopy gaps over the past several decades. Beginning 150 years ago large pines were cut for development, creating thousands of stumps and potential sites for the endemic root disease fungus *Heterobasidion irregulare* to infect. Over a 27 year period, researchers from our lab regularly monitored 21 canopy gaps initiated from *H. irregulare* and found they had expanded in area more than 6-fold on average. Additionally, fire suppression led to conifer encroachment onto oak habitat and favored hardwood infections from another native fungal root pathogen *Armillaria mellea*. Between 1971 and 1999, the two native pathogens together had increased gap area from 2.7% to 30% of the 169 ha sampled area. Because these fungi have the potential to spread tree-to-tree, canopy gap openings may persist and grow. 

Past research on *H. irregulare* and *A. mellea* in Yosemite Valley offers a unique opportunity to examine gap progression and forest impacts over long periods of time. The purpose of this study is to quantitatively assess how and why canopy gaps change over time. In this study, I address the following questions:  

**Q1: How do gaps change in terms of i) area, ii) cause of gap formation, and iii) mortality?**  
**Q2: What are the abiotic and biotic factors of i) gap size and ii) growth over time?**  

We have monitored canopy gaps in Yosemite Valley through repeated surveys of belt transects in 1999, 2004, 2011, and most recently in Fall 2018. Aerial photos from 1972 were used to estimate gap areas, allowing us to track changes over a 46-year time frame. This study will help us undstand a more complete picture of tree morality causes.
