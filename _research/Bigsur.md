Understanding why diversity affects disease dynamics is essential for predicting and managing disease outbreaks. By studying natural plant communities impacted by an introduced forest disease, sudden oak death, we empirically evaluated how variation in species composition affects the relationship between diversity and disease measured at the individual and community level. We combined laboratory competence measurements with plant community and disease data from the Big Sur region of California. Individual-level infection risk was driven by the density of a single, common, highly competent host, bay laurel; whereas plot-level infection prevalence varied with the proportion of commonly symptomatic hosts. These distinct underlying mechanisms led to positive, negative, and neutral relationships between diversity and disease risk measured at different scales. Understanding these multi-scale differences is key for managing the health of specific forest species versus ecosystem-wide resilience.  

{% include gallery caption="Potential pathways to a negative diversity-disease relationship may depend on two primary factors related to variation in species composition and the scale at which disease is measured. Illustrated are the hypothesized mechanisms by which diversity may alter individual- and community-level infection risk. Note: ‘Community competence’ is the aggregate density of all species weighted by their competence and is used to incorporate the additional transmission potential from low competence hosts." %}
