Sudden oak death (SOD) is a prominent forest disease, caused by the generalist invasive pathogen *Phytophthora ramorum* that has profoundly impacted California coastal ecosystems. SOD has largely been treated as a two-host system, with bay laurel being the most transmissive host, tanoak less so, and all remaining species as epidemiologically unimportant. However, this conventional understanding of host competencies primarily stems from observational field studies rather than direct measurements on the diverse assemblage of plant species. While much has been learned in its absence, the goal of this study is to formally quantify the sporulation potential of common plant species inhabiting SOD-endemic ecosystems on the California coast. This study will allow us to fill in gaps of the pathogenâ€™s basic biology, understand more about the trajectory of SOD in a changing environment, and finally, generate a more nuanced perspective of how the entire host community contributes to disease risk.  

We use a network of long-term monitoring plots located in the Big Sur region to identify the top 10 most common plant species in both redwood and mixed evergreen forests. Leaf tissue from each species was inoculated in a controlled laboratory environment and assessed for production of its two spore types, sporangia and chlamydospores, the infectious and resistant propagules, respectively. Our results showed that once challenged by *P. ramorum*, almost all plant species were infected and produced spores to some extent. We found sporangia production was greatest in tanoak and bay laurel and the difference was insignificant, and even though other species produced much less, quantities were non-zero. Thus, additional species may play a previously unrecognized role in local transmission. 

Overall, we achieved an empirical foundation to better understand how community composition affects transmission. These findings will help me examine mechanisms of the diversity-disease relationship in a forest disease system. Stay tuned for the next chapter!
