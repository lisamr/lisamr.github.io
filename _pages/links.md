There are many great organizations that I interact with as a supporter or member. You are welcome to ask me more about them or how to get involved as well. Below are some of them:  

- ![](/images/links/goals_logo.jpg){: .align-left} [Girls Outdoor Adventure in Leadership and Science](https://girlsoutdoorscience.com) (GOALS) is an organization that provides a free 2-week backpacking trip with a field-science flare to underrepresented 10th graders in the Sacramento area. We also provide mentorship to the scholars in the following school year. I have worked on the curriculum team and I am currently a mentor.  

- ![](/images/links/sacRT_meeting.jpg){: .align-right} I ride the bus to get from Sacramento to UC Davis campus, which is cheap and fast. UC Davis was going to erradicate the service as we knew it and active riders quickly mobilized to fight it. Due to our work, we saved our express and affordable transit line, which will impact hundreds of riders each week for years to come. I had the privledge to work with such an amazing group. See more at [acrossthecauseway.com](https://acrossthecauseway.com).  

- ![](/images/links/TheCarpentries.png){: .align-left} [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) is an organization run by volunteers that promotes data and software literacy to the community. I am a certified Carpentries Instructor and I have taught R carpentries workshops on the UC Davis campus.  

- ![](/images/links/craft_center.jpg){: .align-right} Hands-down the coolest place in Davis is the [UC Davis Craft Center](https://campusrecreation.ucdavis.edu/recreation/craft-center/craft-classes). If you are ever thinking of attending or working at UC Davis, you should check this place out. There are classes for pottery, woodworking, glass, metal, and more. I learned how to weld in their metal studio and I hope to learn how to blacksmith too!  

- I have been a member of the [Rizzo Lab](https://ucanr.edu/sites/rizzolab/) since Fall of 2016. We generally study forest disease systems, which brings together a set of plant pathologists, ecologists, and people who wear both hats.  

- I have also been a member of the [Graduate Group in Ecology](https://ecology.ucdavis.edu/) since Fall of 2016. It's a very supportive group of students and faculty. There's a wide breadth of expertise, meaning you can likely find the help you need right on campus.
