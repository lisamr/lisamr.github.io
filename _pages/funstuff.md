I'm so lucky to live in a place where I can easily day-trip to the sierras and climb on world class rock throughout the year. I truly love to climb and to not have this represented here would completely misclassify who I am. Below you can find a few photos of rock scrambling in CA and beyond.

I am also a proud cat mama. We have had Lobster since 2015 and Cricket since October 2019.

Mushroom hunting is also a big hobby, though I do it less now that I don't live on the coast.
