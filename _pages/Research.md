My dissertation revolves around understanding why community diversity (sometimes) reduces disease risk. While there is often a negative relationship between diversity and disease (i.e. the 'dilution effect'), other times there is a positive or insignificant relationship. I am interested in empirically testing the underlying mechanisms driving the diversity-disease relationship using two systems: *Rhizoctonia solani* in greenhouse mesocosms and Sudden Oak Death.  

I'm also interested in forest disturbances in the Sierra Nevada and had the opportunity to resurvey canopy gap dynamics in Yosemite Valley in 2018.
