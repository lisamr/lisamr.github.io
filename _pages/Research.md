My dissertation largely revolves around understanding why community diversity (sometimes) reduces disease risk. While there is often a negative relationship between diversity and disease (i.e. the 'dilution effect'), other times there is a positive or insignificant relationship. I am interested in empirically testing the underlying mechanisms driving the diversity-disease relationship using two main systems: the *Rhizoctonia solani* pathosystem in greenhouse mesocosms and the sudden oak death disease system.  

I'm also interested in forest disturbances in the Sierra Nevada and had the opportunity to resurvey canopy gap dynamics in Yosemite Valley in 2018.
